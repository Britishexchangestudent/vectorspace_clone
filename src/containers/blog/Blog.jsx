            text="SAN FRANCISCO, June 22, 2021 /PRNewswire/ â€” As the new space race heats up, more humans will be traveling into space than ever before. Spaceflight causes many changes in human health. Humans cannot be sent into space without understanding how to protect and repair human DNA along with tissue regeneration while in space. To understand stressors and develop countermeasures that can be used to protect and repair human DNA while in space, Vectorspace AI welcomes Mina J. Bissell, Ph.D., distinguished senior scientist (the highest rank bestowed at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL)/DOE) in the Biological Systems and Engineering Division, to its Scientific Advisory Board (SAB). Dr. Bissell was previously head of the Biosciences division of LNBL for 14 years along with being the chair of the 200+ page report for the NASA Space Radiation Health Program study related to a mission to Mars."
